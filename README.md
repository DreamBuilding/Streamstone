Streamstone is a small library targeted at building scalable event-sourced applications on top of Azure Table Storage. It has simple, functional style API, heavily inspired by Greg Young's Event Store.

## Features

+ ACID stream operations
+ Optimistic concurrency and idempotency support
+ Queryable user-defined stream and event properties
+ Supports arbitrary entity includes within a batch (for stream snapshots and projections)
+ Virtual partitions (for cross-stream projections, "global" event ordering and multi-tenant apps)

## Installing from NuGet [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Streamstone.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Streamstone/)

To install Streamstone via NuGet, run this command in NuGet package manager console:

    PM> Install-Package Streamstone

## Building from source [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3rsmwblor11b6inq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yevhen/streamstone/branch/master)

To build Streamstone's binaries, just clone the repository and build solution from Visual Studio, Alternatively, run the following command from solution's root directory:

    > Nake.bat

For a list of available commands run `Nake.bat -T`. 

## Design

Streamstone is just a thin layer (library, not a server) on top of Windows Azure Table Storage. It implements low-level mechanics for dealing with event streams, and all heavy-weight lifting is done by underlying store. 

The api is stateless and all exposed objects are immutable, once fully constructed. Streamstone doesn't dictate serialization protocol, so you are free to choose any protocol you want.

Optimistic concurrency is implemented by making version be a part of a RowKey identifier. Idempotence support is done by automatically creating additional entity for every event, with RowKey value set to a unique identifier of a source event (consistent secondary index).

## Usage

##### Essentials
+ Provisioning stream [[see](/Source/Example/Scenarios/S01_Provision_new_stream.cs)]
+ Opening stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S02_Open_stream_for_writing.cs)]
+ Writing to stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S04_Write_to_stream.cs)]
+ Reading from stream [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S05_Read_from_stream.cs)]
+ Optimistic concurrency [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S08_Concurrency_conflicts.cs)]
+ Idempotent processing [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S09_Handling_duplicates.cs)]
+ Custom stream metadata [[see](Source/Example/Scenarios/S07_Custom_stream_metadata.cs)]
+ Virtual partitions [[see]()]

##### Application
+ Using snapshots [[see]()]
+ Creating projections [[see]()]
+ Querying events [[see]()]

## Limitations

The write batch size limit, imposed by Azure Table Storage, is 100 entities, therefore:

+ The maximum write batch size is 99 entities (100 - 1 stream header entity) 
+ With idempotency enabled, maximum write batch size is 49 events (100/2 - 1 stream header entity) 

Other limitations of the underlying Azure Table Storage API:

+ Maximum size of batch is 4MB
+ Maximum size of entity is 1 MB
+ Maximum size of property is 64Kb 
+ Maximum length of property name is 255 chars
+ An entity can have up to 255 custom properties
